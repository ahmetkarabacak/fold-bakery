## Next Steps
1. Test the application locally (`npm run dev`)
2. Verify mobile responsiveness across different screen sizes
3. Test hamburger menu functionality
4. Add actual bakery images (currently using placeholders)
5. Fine-tune animations and transitions
6. Performance optimization
7. Accessibility audit

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Mobile-First Approach
- All base styles target mobile screens
- Breakpoints add desktop enhancements
- Touch targets minimum 44px
- Hamburger menu for mobile navigation

### Animation Strategy
- Hero section: Fade in + slide up animation
- Mobile menu: Slide in from right
- Subtle hover effects on product cards
- Smooth transitions throughout

### Color Usage
- Buttery Yellow: Accents, highlights
- Golden Brown: Primary buttons, CTAs
- Dark Roast: Text, navigation
- Off-White: Backgrounds, cards

### Typography Scale
- Mobile: Smaller base (16px), headings scale from 24px
- Desktop: Larger base (18px), headings up to 64px
- Line heights: 1.5-1.6 for readability

## Implementation Priority
1. ✅ Memory bank setup
2. ✅ Project initialization
3. ✅ Core layout and navbar
4. ✅ Hero section
5. ✅ Product showcase
6. ✅ About section
7. ✅ Footer
8. ⏳ Polish and testing
